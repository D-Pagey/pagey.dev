  <p>
    I am a Software Developer that loves building applications in JavaScript. I’m always thinking about coding, whether that is what I want to learn next or what I’m going to build next.

    Where I have worked:

  <ul

    <li
      class="c2"

      <p>
        I joined as the first Front End Developer to build out UIs from scratch on top of the API platform. I'm also creating a reusable component library to be able to build future UIs quickly and consistently.

        Drover
      </a>
      <p>
        I joined Drover as a Junior Front End Developer and my first project was working solo on rebuilding Ruby on Rails pages into React. Whilst I was confident working in React, I quickly learnt how to work in a large codebase with lots of shared components (and minimal tests!).
      </p>
      <p>
        After 6 months I have been promoted to a mid-level Developer and I believe that I have shown myself to be an equal part of the Front End team. I am constantly looking for ways to improve our codebase and workflow. I have taken advantage of working in a small team by suggesting and implementing improvements quickly. Currently, I am the flag bearer for doing more unit testing and I spend a lot of my free time improving myself in this area.
