# Pagey.dev

This is the repo for my old website which I used as a playground to learn more about building data visualisations.

The charts are built with SVGs, `react-spring` for animation and `d3-scale` for the linear scale.

### Common Scripts:

- `yarn` install dependencies
- `yarn start` run the project locally
- `yarn test` run the test suite
- `yarn lint` to lint the project
- `yarn storybook` run Storybook to see the component library

#### To Do:

- Build card component
- Add checkboxes to checklist
- Style tracker
- Style checklist
- Explain the pages a bit
